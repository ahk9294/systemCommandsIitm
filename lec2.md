##  Prof. Gandham Phannikumar | IIT Madras
In this course 'system commands' we will learn to work with *Linux operating system*.<br><br>We will learn to use the linuxOS from *Command line environment*.<br>

###### But Why would anyone like to work in Command Line environment?
<sup>[-Prof GP-] </sup>When we are working with **Linux operating system** we will be able to use it to its fullest potential when we are comfortable with *commands* and *command line environment*.<br><br>We can *combine* these commands to form a **script**.<br><br>And then we can use these scripts to be launched at specific times and thereby *automate* some of the task that we wolud like to do in the Linux environment.<br><br>So the command line environment should be seen as not only a way you type out *instructions* to the computer, but also as a path towards **automation**.

## The Terminal emulator
To "type" commands and work with the operating system we need a *command line environment* which is provided by an app called *terminal emulator*.<br>There are several terminal emulators available in different distributions of the Linux OS.<br><br>Some of them are -
- **Terminal** in ubuntu (available GNOME Environment and highly customizable).
- **Exter**.
- **Guake** (can be activated and deactivated with F12, once it is installed it will remain in the background listening to your commands.You can open or close it at your wish).
- **console** (mainly available in KDE environment of the Linux OS).

## The command prompt 
When we open the terminal emmulator we will notice a string like<br>```abh9294@abh9294-desktop:~$```<br>This string is called *command prompt*. We will discuss its details in a moment.<br> Following the command prompt we notice a dippering textbar, it represents that the *shell* is asking for the command to enter.
